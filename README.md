Bamazon

This CLI back-end app is an Amazon-like storefront utilizing Node.js and MySQL database. 

Technologies used: Node.js, MySQL.

It presents two views:
The customer view allows customers to buy items. It notifies customers of either insufficient stock levels or an order total (based on quantity purchased and price).
The manager view allows the manager to view and replenish stock, and add new products.

IMPORTANT NOTE: To use this app, you need to provide your own MySQL login credentials and create a databse using the schema I've included. Because this can be time consuming, I've uploaded a demo video for those short on time but curious enough to see this app in action.
