This Node.js app is an Amazon-like storefront utilizing Node.js and MySQL database. 

Technologies used: Node.js, MySQL.

It presents two views:

Customers can purchase items from the store's inventory. They are notified of insufficient stock levels and the order total based on quantity purchased and item price.

The manager view allows the manager to view all stock, view low quantity stock, replenish stock, and add new products to the database.

IMPORTANT NOTE: To use this app, provide your own MySQL login credentials and create a databse using the schema I've included. Because this can be time consuming, I've uploaded a demo video for those short on time but curious enough to see this app in action.
