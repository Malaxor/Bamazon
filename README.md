Bamazon

This CLI back-end app is an Amazon-like storefront utilizing Node.js and MySQL database. 

Technologies used: Node.js, MySQL.

It presents two views:
The customer view that will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. It notifies the customer of either insufficient stock levels or a order total based on quantity purchased and item price.

The manager view allows the manager to view all stock, view low quantity stock, add product to current stock levels, and add new products to the database.

IMPORTANT NOTE: To use this app, you need to provide your own MySQL login credentials and create a databse using the schema I've included. Because this can be time consuming, I've uploaded a demo video for those short on time but curious enough to see this app in action.
